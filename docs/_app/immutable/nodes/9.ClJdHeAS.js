The Simple Paper Wallet Generator creates two separate QR codes: one for the public address to receive funds and another for the private key when spending is needed. Both are generated entirely in the browser for maximum privacy.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The public address QR code contains the Bitcoin address string prefixed with the standard bitcoin URI scheme. When scanned by a mobile wallet, this automatically populates the send screen with the correct receiving address. Users can simply point their phone camera at the printed code to initiate a transfer, reducing errors from typing complex character sequences.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The private key QR code encodes the full Wallet Import Format string. Scanning this with a compatible wallet application triggers the import process directly. Most modern mobile wallets recognize WIF-encoded private keys in QR format and prompt for confirmation before sweeping funds into a new address under the user's control.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Both QR codes use high error correction levels to ensure reliable scanning even if the print quality is less than perfect or minor damage occurs over time. The codes are sized appropriately for easy reading by smartphone cameras while remaining compact on the printed page.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">This dual QR approach supports different use cases. The public address QR can be shared freely for receiving payments, while the private key QR should remain completely private until the user decides to spend the funds. Many users cover or fold the private key section to prevent accidental exposure.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">QR codes also enable air-gapped signing workflows. Advanced users can scan the unsigned transaction QR from an online device with an offline signing device, then broadcast the signed transaction separately. While this tool focuses on basic paper wallet creation, the QR format supports these more sophisticated security practices.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Testing QR codes immediately after printing is crucial. Users should scan both codes with a wallet app to verify they read correctly before funding the address. Any scanning issues can be addressed by reprinting while the digital version is still available.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The combination of human-readable strings and machine-readable QR codes provides flexibility for different scenarios, from quick mobile payments to careful long-term storage management.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">QR codes transform paper wallets from static documents into interactive tools that bridge the gap between physical security and digital convenience.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">Do all wallet apps support QR scanning?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Most modern mobile Bitcoin wallets include built-in QR scanners for both addresses and private keys.</p></details> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">Should I test the QR codes before funding?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Yes, always verify both QR codes scan correctly immediately after printing.</p></details> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">Can QR codes degrade over time?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">High-quality prints with sufficient error correction remain readable for years when stored properly.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-q8x3kg">QR codes make paper wallets practical for real-world use while maintaining security.</p></article></div>`);function W(d){var e=w();b("q8x3kg",g=>{var a=x(),h=f(u(a),6);s(4),i(()=>l(h,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post6`)),v(()=>{y.title="QR Codes for Easy Scanning and Import | Paper Wallet Insights"}),r(g,a)});var t=n(e),m=n(t);s(4),o(t),s(2),o(e),i(()=>l(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),r(d,e)}export{W as component,T as universal};
