While the generation process ensures cryptographic strength, physical security determines whether funds remain safe over time. Following established best practices maximizes protection against theft, damage, and loss.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Begin by generating the wallet on an air-gapped computer whenever possible. Download the tool while online, disconnect from all networks, then generate and print. This eliminates any chance of key exposure during creation. Clear browser data afterward to remove temporary traces.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Use a dedicated printer that has never been networked, or ensure any connected printer is free of malware. Avoid public or shared printers completely. Print multiple copies for redundancy, but store them in separate secure locations.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Immediately after printing, test both QR codes with a mobile wallet app while still offline. Verify the public address matches the printed string and the private key imports correctly. Only fund the wallet after successful verification.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Consider using high-quality archival paper and pigment-based ink for longevity. Laser printers generally produce more durable results than inkjet. Some users laminate wallets or use waterproof sleeves for protection against moisture, though care must be taken to avoid heat damage to ink.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Storage location is critical. Fireproof safes, safety deposit boxes, or buried waterproof containers provide excellent protection. Split storage across multiple geographic locations reduces risk from single-point failures like fire or theft.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Many designs include a fold line to cover the private key section. This prevents casual viewing while allowing quick access when needed. Tamper-evident seals or envelopes add another layer of protection against unauthorized access.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Document the existence and general location of paper wallets in estate planning materials without revealing specific details. Trusted family members should know a recovery process exists without having immediate access to keys.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Regular inspection ensures physical integrity over time. Check for fading, water damage, or degradation annually. Create fresh copies from backups if any deterioration is noticed.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">These practices transform a simple printed document into a robust long-term storage solution capable of preserving wealth across decades or generations.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">How many copies should I make?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">At least three copies stored in separate secure locations provides good redundancy.</p></details> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Should I include the mnemonic on the print?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Yes for convenience, or store separately for enhanced security—choose based on your threat model.</p></details> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">What if the paper degrades over time?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Regular inspection and archival materials help; always maintain at least one pristine backup copy.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-jo8es1">Physical security is the final and most important layer of paper wallet protection.</p></article></div>');function I(d){var e=P();w("jo8es1",u=>{var a=j(),g=h(f(a),6);t(4),o(()=>l(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post7`)),v(()=>{y.title="Best Practices for Printing and Storing Paper Wallets | Paper Wallet Insights"}),r(u,a)});var s=i(e),m=i(s);t(4),n(s),t(2),n(e),o(()=>l(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),r(d,e)}export{I as component,B as universal};
